# Torvald
Torvald is an intelligent os assistant that you could use like talking to your best friend.

The idea of Torvald is to talk with him within audio.
Like an Google assistant but more powerful and operating system actions.
In the behind, Torvald will produce a script code in python to translate your voice into operating system actions.

- Examples:

```User: Torvald, change my wallpaper to a random galaxy image from internet.```
Torvald will generate this script in python and execute it.
