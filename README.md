# COOPER 
COOPER is an intelligent os assistant that you could use like talking to your best friend.

The idea behind COOPER is to talk with him within audio (advanced versions).
Like an Google assistant but more powerful and operating system actions.
In the behind, COOPER will produce a script code in python to translate your voice into operating system or another actions.

- Examples:

```User: cooper change my wallpaper to a random galaxy image.```
Cooper will generate this script in python and execute it.
